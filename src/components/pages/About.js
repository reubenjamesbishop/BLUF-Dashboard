          <p class="about-paragraph">
            <strong>BLUF</strong> presentations take the Bottom Line Up Front
            approach, where the presenter uses a simple structure to concisely
            present a topic. This presenter has little time to research and
            prepare and can only use a whiteboard marker to assist.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            <strong>BLUF</strong> presentations have a significantly larger
            emphasis on the professional development of the presenter than the
            technical information presented. This focuses on polishing valuable
            skills for future professional presentations and creates a more
            casual atmosphere to encourages audience interaction. actually sorry
            maybe this is better
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            <strong>BLUF</strong> presentations can be used to test your
            presentation skills by presenting on a topic in which you have
            little prior knowledge and limited time to prepare. 
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            Presenting in such situations can be daunting but can quickly
            develop your research, preparation and presentation skills. The aim
            is for each session to be run only as fun learning exercises, with
            topics coming from anything members are interested in.
          </p>
          <p class="about-paragraph">
            Simplicity in presentation is also key and to minimise preparation
            time, each presentation is restricted to a whiteboard and marker. 
            The BLUF group aims to foster an encouraging environment where it is
            ok to be out of your comfort zone and we all help each other
            improve.
